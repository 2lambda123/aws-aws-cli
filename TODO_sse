# TODO migrate test_sse shell script "tests" to functional written in python
  tests

# TODO test_sse tests different ways of passing customer key and customer key
  md5 on the command line, but does not test the same for copy source customer
  key/md5 (although these two use the same code path for arg processing)

# TODO update aws s3 {cp,sync} manpages with examples

# TODO maybe add debug logging for new options and option encrichment, etc.?

# TODO is there a better way to do the opt parsing within the awscli framework?

# TODO validate that ServerSideEncryption, SSECustomerAlgorithm,
  SSECustomerKeyMD5, and/or SSEKMSKeyId values present in response data after
  certain APIs (head_object(), put_object(), get_object(), copy_object(),
  create_multipart_upload(), upload_part(), upload_part_copy()) have expected
  values given the request (and, not specific to SSE, there is no checking of
  these now for ETag, etc.). Approximate source locations as of 2015-08-27
  (these comments were removed afterwards, so source line numbers are slightly
  different; look for use of client APIs above):

    535:            # TODO validate that ServerSideEncryption and/or SSEKMSKeyId values

    (complete_multipart_upload() has only ServerSideEncryption and/or
     SSEKMSKeyId. The rest have all four.)

# TODO consider storing md5sum/sha256sum in object metadata (this is not
  specific to SSE, but to anything that alters ETag like multipart) so it could
  later be used (perhaps for sync)
