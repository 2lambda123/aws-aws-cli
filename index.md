# Welcome!

Thanks for your interest in contributing to the AWS CLI! We welcome everyone to contribute. If you're interested in one or more of the following, then this guide is for you:

- Learning about the AWS CLI contribution process
- Proposing and discussing new features or improvements
- Fixing documentation and examples
- Making code changes

The goal with this guide is to give contributors confidence when making a contribution. We want to set expectations of maintainers and contributors so we respect everyone's time and effort. We do not expect that you need to read this document from beginning to end to make a contribution. Instead, it serves as an authoritative reference when you need it.

This project has adopted the [Amazon Open Source Code of Conduct](https://aws.github.io/code-of-conduct), and this extends to the contribution process. For more information, please see the [Code of Conduct FAQ](https://aws.github.io/code-of-conduct-faq).

## Communication

If you have a question about your contribution, the best way to get help is to write a comment on the issue or pull request you're working on, and a maintainer will get back to you.

If you are having trouble using the AWS CLI or have a usage question, please use our [discussion forum](https://github.com/aws/aws-cli/discussions/categories/q-a) and we'll respond there.
