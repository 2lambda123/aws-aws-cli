# Welcome!

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI)! We welcome everyone to contribute. 

This guide covers the following topics:

* The AWS CLI contribution process
* Proposing and discussing new features or improvements
* Updating documentation and adding/updating examples
* Making code changes
* Support requests and bug reports

This project has adopted the [Amazon Open Source Code of Conduct](https://aws.github.io/code-of-conduct), and this extends to the contribution process. For more information, please see the [Code of Conduct FAQ](https://aws.github.io/code-of-conduct-faq).

## Contribution process

The AWS CLI maintainers use a process to guide you, the contributors, from opening a new issue to merging a pull request. The goal is to assure that contributions are addressed systematically and transparently.

If you want to make a change to the AWS CLI or are interested in learning about the process, you can get started using the [Code contribution quick steps](code_quicksteps.md), [Code example contribution quick steps](docs_quicksteps.md), or the [full contribution process](contribution_process.md).

## Contacting the team

To get help on your contribution, write a comment on the issue or pull request you’re working on, and a maintainer will get back to you.

If you are having trouble using the AWS CLI or have a usage question, please use our [discussion forum](https://github.com/aws/aws-cli/discussions/categories/q-a) and we’ll respond there.
