# Welcome to the AWS CLI contribution guide!
{: .fs-9 }

Get involved with the AWS CLI.
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

Welcome, and thanks for your interest in contributing to the AWS CLI! If you're interested in one or more of the following, then this guide is for you!

- Learning about the AWS CLI contribution process
- Proposing and discussing new features
- Making suggestions for improvements
- Fixing documentation and examples
- Making code changes

The goal with this guide is to give contributors confidence of when making a contribution. We aim to set expectations of maintainers and contributors so we respect everyone's time and effort. We do not expect that you need to read this document from beginning to end to make a contribution. Instead, it serves as an authoritative reference when you need it.

We've just begun making improvements to our contribution process. Since we haven't completed that, this guide is a work in progress.

This project has adopted the [Amazon Open Source Code of Conduct](https://aws.github.io/code-of-conduct), and this extends to the contribution process. For more information, please see the [Code of Conduct FAQ](https://aws.github.io/code-of-conduct-faq).

## Contribution process

The AWS CLI has defined a process to guide contributions from opening a new issue to getting a contribution merged. You can read more about that on our [Contribution process](docs/contribution_process.md) page. 

## Communication

If you have a question about your contribution, the best way to get help is to write a comment on the issue or pull request you're working on, and a maintainer will get back to you.

If you are having trouble using the AWS CLI or have a usage question, please use our [discussion forum](https://github.com/aws/aws-cli/discussions/categories/q-a) and we'll respond there.
